# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

- Task 0 - prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
- Task 1- prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Task 2- prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Task 3-a function that checks for lowercase character.
	* Prototype: int _islower(int c);
	* Returns 1 if c is lowercase
	* Returns 0 otherwise
- Task 4-a function that checks for alphabetic character.
	* Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
	* Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
	* Returns 0 otherwise
- Task 5-a function that prints the sign of a number.
	* Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
	* Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
	* Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
	* Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
- Task 6-computes the absolute value of an integer.
	* Prototype: int _abs(int);
- Task 7-prints the last digit of a number.
	* Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
	* Returns the value of the last digit
- Task 8-prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- Task 9-prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- Task 10-adds two integers and returns the result.
- Task 11-a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
	* Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
	* Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
	* Numbers should be printed in order
	* The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
	* The last printed number should be 98
- Taks 12-prints the n times table, starting with 0.
	* Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
	* If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything.
- Task 13-If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
